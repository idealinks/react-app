/* 
This empty css file is needed to get around a known issue in next.js
that is detailed in the following github issue: 
https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/issues/282#issuecomment-432127816

This is the source where this workaround was taken from.
https://with-css-modules-nhesxgevhn.now.sh/_src 

We should monitor this issue, and hopefully sometime soon a proper 
fix will be released.
